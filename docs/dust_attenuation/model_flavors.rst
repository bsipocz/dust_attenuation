Model Flavors
#############

There are three different types of models: averages, radiative transfer based,
and shape fitting.

Average models
==============

   These models provide averages from the literature with the ability to
   interpolate between the observed data points.

   Calzetti.  Any others?

Radiative Transfer Based Models
===============================

   These models provide predictions on the shape based on amount of dust,
   star/dust geometry, and other star/dust parameters.

   Witt & Gordon (2000) spherical galactic environments.


Shape fitting models
====================

   These models allow for more arbitrary shapes to be modeled than the
   other model flavors.

   Charlot & Fall.
   Others.
